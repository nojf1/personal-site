                    At least this site looks nice, right? Totally not made by an amateur, sure.
                    But hey, at least it's not a blank page! That's something, right? Right?
                    But if you're looking for something, you're in the wrong place.
                    You're not going to find anything here. Nothing at all. Nada. Zilch.
                    But hey, at least you can enjoy the view, right? Right?
                    I made this site as a personal project, so don't expect much.
                    This is the only page on this site by the way, so don't bother looking for more.
